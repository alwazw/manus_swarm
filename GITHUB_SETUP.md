# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Set the repository name to: `swarm`
4. Add a description: "Docker Swarm stack configuration with multiple services"
5. Set visibility to **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Configure Git Remote

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/swarm.git

# Verify the remote was added correctly
git remote -v
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 3: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push the main branch to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: Using SSH (if you have SSH keys configured)

If you prefer to use SSH instead of HTTPS:

```bash
# Add remote using SSH
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/swarm.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Verify Upload

1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/swarm`
2. Verify that all files are present:
   - README.md
   - docker-compose.yml
   - All service configuration files (*.yml)
   - .env.example
   - deployment-report.md
   - .gitignore

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

If you encounter authentication issues:

1. **For HTTPS**: GitHub may prompt for username and password/token
2. **For SSH**: Ensure your SSH keys are properly configured

### Permission Denied

If you get permission denied errors:
- Make sure you have write access to the repository
- Check that the repository name and username are correct
- Verify your GitHub credentials

### Repository Already Exists

If the repository name is already taken:
- Choose a different name (e.g., `docker-swarm-stack`, `my-swarm-config`)
- Update the remote URL accordingly

## Next Steps After Upload

1. **Add collaborators** if this is a team project
2. **Configure branch protection** for the main branch
3. **Add repository topics** for better discoverability
4. **Create releases** for stable versions
5. **Set up GitHub Actions** for automated testing (optional)

## Security Notes

- The `.gitignore` file excludes sensitive files like passwords and secrets
- Never commit actual passwords or API keys to the repository
- Use the `.env.example` file as a template for configuration
- Keep your actual `.env` file local and secure
